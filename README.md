# The Problem

As a team of experienced solo travellers to aspiring solo travellers, we found that current solo travelling apps tend not to be tailored to solo travellers, from lack of personalisation, to only focusing on mainstream attractions resulting in lack of independent run businesses.
Other apps utilise wish list systems but don't allow to save intineraries or create personalised day plans for less stress and an overall better experience while travelling.

# Our solution
We have a curated database of attractions, catered to solo travellers. Allowing users to save their day plans. Streamlined and easy to navigate to minimise the friction of solo travelling. 
<br/>
We have implemented a filtration system that allows users to further narrow down their options. Offering higher than average specificity level in the filtration system, such as energy level, dog friendliness and budgets. At the same time remaining quite simple with the range of 3 options (low, medium, high) in filters without being overwhelming for the user.

# How our app works
All of our attractions are stored within a database. Through the front-end making requests to the database you can use the filtration system to curate a personalised selection of Activities that is presented to the user on a Carousel, having the choice to lock in and like desired activities with our heart and lock button features.
Once you have selected your favourite activities for your day, you'll click view day plan where you'll be redirected to your own personalised and unique day plan to enjoy without the stress or hassle.
